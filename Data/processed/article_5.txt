Article:         ST LOUIS  Recycling hasnt had the best track record in the St Louis area recently In late 2021 St Louis City officials told 5 On Your Side that they were no longer picking up trash and recycling separately due to staffing shortages This resulted in residents recycling ending up in the citys landfills The city has since stopped taking recycling to landfills and restarted transporting recyclables to recycling centers as of May 2022 But the short stint has created a lasting poor perception of recycling in the St Louis area Galen Benson from St Charles is one of the many viewers who asked the VERIFY team to find out whether St Louisarea residents were wasting their time separating trash from recycling We looked into the recycling process at a regional scale to find out Are most of the St Louis areas recyclables being recycled  Yes the vast majority of what goes into the areas Material Recovery Facilities ends up going through the entire recycling process The counties around St Louis primarily rely on three companies for their recycling needs Republic Services WM and Waste Connections Around 80 of households in the St Louis metro area are serviced by the Republic Services Material Recovery Facility MRF in Hazelwood according to cityand stateagencies WM also drops off their pickedup recycling at the facility The facility recovers 79 of that material on average while 21 is contaminated plastic film yard waste clothing and trash Waste Connections doesnt own its own recycling center but it partners with and uses the Quincy Recycling MRF in Bridgeton for its recyclable processing needs Quincy Recycling told 5 On Your Side that 84 of recyclables that arrive at the facility are processed while the other 16 are contaminated materials To VERIFY these numbers we spoke to recycling experts in the area They said that both Republic Services and Quincy Recyclings numbers were in line with national recycling trends When recyclables are picked up from a residence or a business they are transported to an MRF like Republic Services and Quincy Recyclings MRFs There the recyclables are sorted and contaminated materials are discarded Its a type of firewall said Ponzi an environmental educator in St Louis for more than thirty years All of that comingled single stream mishmash is all sorted back out into its constituent streams and those sorted materials are bailed and brokered to someone who wants to use them to make new products Sanitation workers are not indiscriminately throwing recyclables into the trash However some of what ends up in recycling bins is either too contaminated to process or wasnt recyclable in the first place and therefore is sent to the landfill This is not something the refuse department can do much about The way items go into alley recycling dumpsters sometimes theyre just too contaminated Corbett said If we can get the word out to everyone on how to recycle properly and how to recycle responsibly then we know that this will get better Republic Services contamination threshold can be met in numerous ways according to Jeremy Walters the companys sustainability ambassador Once paper and cardboard are soiled with food or liquid they must be thrown away Walters said If loads of recyclables come to the recycling center with heavy amounts of contamination we do our best to segregate this material so that it does not further contaminate good recyclables White advised residents looking to make sure the most materials are recycled as possible should remember three things We can VERIFY The vast majority of what is placed into St Louis area recycling bins go through the entire recycling process Have a question you want us to VERIFY Email hbasslerksdkcom or verifyksdkcom with your claim Craving more VERIFY See every St Louisarea claim weve looked into here Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings
