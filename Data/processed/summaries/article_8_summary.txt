Headline: Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez are officially divorced
Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez are now officially divorced after a nearly three-year marriage. The dissolution of their marriage was finalized through a Los Angeles Superior Court judgment, with Grande making a one-time payment, splitting proceeds from the sale of their home, and agreeing on the terms of their settlement. They had no children and their split, which was due to irreconcilable differences, moved quickly through the court system. The couple began dating in January 2020, got engaged in December of the same year, and were married in a private ceremony in May 2021. Ariana Grande has recently released her seventh studio album and is set to appear in the film adaptation of the stage musical "Wicked."
