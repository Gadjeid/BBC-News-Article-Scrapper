Summary: The Manhattan district attorney's office informed the judge that prosecutors would no longer proceed with the case surrounding hand-drafted lyrics to Eagles hits.
Article:         NEW YORK  From the start the case was highly unusual a criminal prosecution centered on the disputed ownership of a cache of handdrafted lyrics to Hotel California and other Eagles hits Its end was even more unexpected In the middle of trial New York prosecutors abruptly dropped their case Wednesday against three collectibles experts who had been accused of scheming to hang onto and peddle the pages which Eagles cofounder Don Henley maintained were stolen private artifacts of the bands creative process In explaining the stunning turnabout prosecutors agreed that defense lawyers had essentially been blindsided by getting 6000 pages of communications involving Henley and his attorneys and associates The material was provided to both sides only in the past few days after Henley and his lawyers apparently made a lateinthegame decision to waive their attorneyclient privilege to keep legal discussions confidential These delayed disclosures revealed relevant information that the defense should have had the opportunity to explore when Henley and other prosecution witnesses were on the stand late last month Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Aaron Ginandes told the court With that rare books dealer Glenn Horowitz former Rock  Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and rock memorabilia seller Edward Kosinski were cleared of all the charges They had included conspiracy to criminally possess stolen property The case centered on roughly 100 pages of legalpad pages from the creation of a classic rock colossus The 1976 album Hotel California ranks as the thirdbiggest seller of all time in the US in no small part on the strength of its evocative smoothly unsettling title track about a place where you can check out any time you like but you can never leave Prosecutors had said the defendants knew the pages had a dubious chain of possession but sought to keep and sell them anyway contriving to fabricate a provenance that would pass muster with auction houses and stave off Henleys demands for the return of the handwritten sheets Through their lawyers the defendants contended they were rightful owners of pages that werent stolen by anyone The next step is building back our reputations Inciardi said in a written statement after the dismissal Kosinski leaving court said only that he felt very good about the cases end Horowitz hugged tearful family members then left court without commenting A lawyer for Henley meanwhile signaled that he isnt done with the matter As the victim in this case Mr Henley has once again been victimized by this unjust outcome attorney Dan Petrocelli said in a statement He will pursue all his rights in the civil courts One of Kosinskis lawyers Scott Edelman said they also were going to evaluate next steps The district attorney in this case got blinded by the fame and fortune of a celebrity Edelman said outside court and that blinded them to the information that they werent being given Judge Curtis Farber for his part said the prosecutors were apparently manipulated Without naming names he said witnesses and their lawyers used attorneyclient privilege to obfuscate and hide information that they believed would be damaging The communications that led to the case dismissal werent released publicly But in court earlier this week defense lawyers said the trove had identified additional potential witnesses and raised questions about some testimony from Henley and others The defense maintained that Henley gave the lyrics pages decades ago to a writer who worked on a neverpublished Eagles biography and later sold the handwritten sheets to Horowitz He in turn sold them to Inciardi and Kosinski who started putting some of the pages up for auction in 2012 These are three factually innocent men Inciardis lawyer Stacey Richman Henley who realized they were missing only when they showed up for sale reported them stolen He testified at the trial that he let the writer pore through the pages for research but never gifted them or gave them to anybody to keep or sell The writer Ed Sanders wasnt charged with any crime and wasnt called to testify He hasnt responded to messages about the trial Defense lawyers said in court Monday that emails theyd just received showed that Henley initially suspected someone else before someone reminded him of the decadesold book project According to the defense the emails also showed that Henleys lawyers and investigator initially decided to characterize the pages disappearance as a burglary  and make no mention of Sanders 1979 book contract  because they believed that referring to a burglary would help their cause Messages seeking comment were sent to the Henley attorneys involved The contract often mentioned during the trial said the Eagles would furnish Sanders with material which would remain the bands sole property Prosecutors emphasized the last part Defense lawyers said that their clients hadnt known about the contract but that it showed the Eagles agreed to provide things to Sanders Prosecutors said Wednesday that they had repeatedly asked various witnesses to waive their attorneyclient privilege but they chose not to until the past few days But defense lawyers noted that the Manhattan DAs office worked on the case for over seven years While the defendants were accused of not asking enough questions about the pages ownership it appears that failure to do a full investigation lies with the other side said one of Horowitzs lawyers Jonathan Bach This case should never have been brought On the road to its breakdown the nonjury trial provided sometimes gossipy peeks into the height of the Eagles career and the workings of the music business The court heard the bands longtime manager lament on a decadesold tape aboutdealing with a pampered rock star and heard Henley himself answer questions about matters ranging from creative methods to contracts to cocaine During testimony that stretched across three days the Grammywinning singer and drummer held in his hands some of the pages on which he and sometimes Eagles cofounder Glenn Frey spitballed words to such Eagles songs as After the Thrill is Gone One of These Nights and The Long Run Henley recounted highlights from the bands heyday such asthe writing of Hotel California And he discussed personal low points including his1980 arrest after authorities reported finding a 16yearold girl who was ailing from drug use at his home It happened as the Eagles were breaking up and Henley was reeling The band was everything to me and its something Id been working towards since I was 15 years old It was my whole world and my identity he said We had accomplished so much in the previous decade In the long run it wasnt the end The Eagles reunited in 1994 and are still touring  Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings
